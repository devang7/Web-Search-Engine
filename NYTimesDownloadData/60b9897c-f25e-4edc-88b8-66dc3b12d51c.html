			<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The debate on Monday in the House of Commons over the fallout from the Panama Papers lasted 1 hour, 27 minutes and 21 seconds.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">No smoking guns were revealed in Prime Minister David Cameron&#8217;s personal finances, or in the finances of other officials. And there were no major policy announcements.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Still, the parliamentary debate was the most vigorous discussion of the use of offshore bank accounts and shell companies to conceal personal wealth or avoid taxes since the Panama Papers were released. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It was also a chance for Britain&#8217;s two main parties to lay out their competing visions. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Cameron defended his father&#8217;s use of offshore funds and — after an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/08/world/europe/vladimir-putin-panama-papers-american-plot.html">initially clumsy response</a> to reports based on the leaked documents from a Panamanian law firm — he said he had now <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/live/david-cameron-speech/cameron-defends-existing-disclosure-rules">disclosed</a> more about his personal finances than any of his predecessors.</p>

<p class="nyt-article-summary">The prime minister has condemned offshore accounts used to avoid taxes, but leaked documents show that his family has profited from an offshore investment fund.</p>
</p></div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Cameron also promised <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/live/david-cameron-speech/new-criminal-campaign">new criminal penalties</a> for companies that fail to prevent their employees from facilitating tax evasion, and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/live/david-cameron-speech/anguilla-and-guernsey">promised greater transparency</a> by British territories and dependencies that are often used as tax havens.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The opposition Labour Party, whose leader, Jeremy Corbyn, embodies the party&#8217;s leftward shift, failed to score any knockout punches, but underscored a basic theme that has resonated with voters on both sides of the Atlantic: The rules of the game are rigged to favor &#8220;the superrich,&#8221; as Mr. Corbyn <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/live/david-cameron-speech/corbyn-on-cameron-a-master-class-in-the-art-of-distraction">put it</a>. And at least one of his parliamentary allies drew connections between that perceived unfairness and London&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/live/david-cameron-speech/dirty-money-propping-up-the-london-property-market">soaring home prices</a> — perhaps the most pressing issue  as the capital prepares for mayoral elections next month.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Cameron&#8217;s Conservatives defended themselves as the party of people who want to get ahead in life; the prime minister <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/live/david-cameron-speech/cameron-defends-disclosure">called</a> the Labour Party an &#8220;enemy of aspiration,&#8221; and one lawmaker decried the Labour Party&#8217;s &#8220;politics of envy.&#8221; </p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Although the disclosure rules have not changed, the public debate has set off a race to release tax returns.

			<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">One of the most substantive policy announcements to emerge from Monday&#8217;s parliamentary debate involves British dependencies and territories that are often used to create offshore companies for tax purposes. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Prime Minister David Cameron said on Monday that the majority of these jurisdictions have agreed to compile information on offshore companies registered there; to share the information among themselves; and to create centralized registries of &#8220;beneficial ownership&#8221; — the individuals and entities that actually benefit from a company that is held under someone else&#8217;s name. (Some reformers want Mr. Cameron to go further, by insisting that those registries be made public.) </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The jurisdictions that have agreed to these steps include Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Gibraltar, the Isle of Man, Jersey, Montserrat and Turks and Caicos.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Two, however, have not: Anguilla and Guernsey. Mr. Cameron noted several times on Monday that they were exceptions to the new standards his government supports. He did not explain why they were holding out, but expressed hope that they would fall in line.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Anguilla, a popular tax haven, is a British overseas territory in the Caribbean; it is part of the United Kingdom but has its own legislature. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Guernsey, in the English Channel off the coast of Normandy, is one of three Crown dependencies, along with Jersey and the Isle of Man. Officially, it is a self-governing possession of the Crown, and not part of the United Kingdom. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In practice, the British government has overwhelming influence over both the overseas territories and the Crown dependencies, so it would be difficult for them to resist London&#8217;s authority, if the government were to ultimately insist that they adopt uniform policies. How much London will insist on such uniformity — and whether the overhaul will be sufficient — remain matters of debate.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Monday afternoon&#8217;s debate in Parliament over the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/05/world/panama-papers-explainer.html">Panama Papers</a> scandal was an open discussion of the role of wealth and privilege in Britain. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Prime Minister David Cameron is a graduate of Eton College, one of the country&#8217;s most prestigious boarding schools, and of Oxford University.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Cameron had said, in the days since the revelations from the Panama Papers, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/09/world/europe/panama-papers-prime-minister-david-cameron-of-britain-on-tax-avoidance.html?ref=liveblog">“I’ve never hidden the fact that I’m a very lucky person.&#8221;</a></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;I had wealthy parents who gave me a great upbringing, who paid for me to go to an amazing school,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I’ve never tried to be anything that I’m not.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Still, the news that his father had an offshore investment company, and that the prime minister had <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/11/world/europe/david-cameron-panama-papers-tax-return.html">sold shares in the fund at a profit</a>, has been embarrassing for the Conservative Party. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">One member of the party, Michael Fabricant, who represents the Lichfield constituency in Staffordshire in the West Midlands, came to Mr. Cameron&#8217;s defense.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;He should not be ashamed that the had the good fortune to be born into a well-off family,&#8221; Mr. Fabricant said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not a sin for his parents, quite naturally, to want their savings to be cascaded down through the generations. He has nothing to be ashamed of.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Fabricant said: &#8220;No matter how much information he wants to divulge, nothing will satisfy some of those people on the Labour front bench.&#8221; </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Cameron used the opportunity to reiterate his earlier position that existing disclosure rules for members of Parliament were adequate. He noted that he had fended off demands that lawmakers and cabinet members be required to disclose all of their personal financial interests. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">While members of the Labour Party have moved further to the left in recent years — notably by electing Jeremy Corbyn, a far-left backbencher, as the party&#8217;s leader last year — the Conservative Party has tried to position itself as being in the center of the political spectrum. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Just this month, Mr. Cameron noted, the government raised the standard personal allowance — the amount of income individuals do not have to pay tax on — to £11,000, or about $15,700, from £10,600.</p>

			<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Several major themes have arisen in Monday afternoon&#8217;s debate over tax sheltering. One is the question of individual tax evaders versus the havens — including the British Virgin Islands — that are seen as facilitating tax avoidance.  Another is the question of transparency and disclosure.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;Can the prime minister guarantee that the law will make offshore tax dodging illegal?&#8221; asked Liz Saville Roberts, a member of Parliament with the Welsh party Plaid Cymru. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Prime Minister David Cameron noted that tax evasion was already illegal and called it an issue separate from the sharing of information across jurisdictions, and the ability to examine who are the owners of companies. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But he added, &#8220;We shouldn&#8217;t use that to say that it&#8217;s wrong for people or trade unions or companies or pension schemes to invest in unit trusts listed in other countries.&#8221; </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Unit trusts, sometimes also known as open-ended funds, allow investors to buy an ownership stake in a range of investments, which are managed by a fund manager. They are common investment vehicles.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;The unit trust does not exist to make money for itself,&#8221; Mr. Cameron said. The investors are the ones who make or lose money, and are responsible for the taxes on any gains, he said.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But the fact that so many of these investment vehicles are based overseas has itself become politically sensitive — the vast majority of individual investors do not participate in such funds.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Dennis Skinner, an 84-year-old member of Parliament and a senior member of the British Labour Party, was ejected from the chamber after referring to Prime Minister David Cameron as &#8220;Dodgy Dave.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Westminster debates are legendary as rough-and-tumble affairs, and the debate on Monday over tax shelters was no different.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But it went even further than usual, after John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, whose role is to serve as an impartial arbiter of debates, ordered Mr. Skinner to withdraw his use of the wordy &#8220;dodgy.&#8221; Under parliamentary rules, members may not accuse one another of dishonesty or use profanity — though the line at which insult crosses over into &#8220;unparliamentary language&#8221; is often hard to draw.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Skinner refused to withdraw his characterization of the prime minister as &#8220;dodgy,&#8221; so Mr. Bercow ordered him removed from the chamber. Mr. Skinner walked out.</p>

			<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Angus Robertson, the leader of the Scottish National Party&#8217;s bloc in Britain&#8217;s Parliament, has challenged the prime minister to detail the government&#8217;s efforts to crack down on illegal tax shelters. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The Scots are a significant bloc in Parliament. Mr. Robertson&#8217;s colleague Nicola Sturgeon, the party&#8217;s leader and the first minister of Scotland, was the first national leader to release her tax returns; her decision to do so, over the weekend, prompted Prime Minister David Cameron and Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the main opposition, the Labour Party, to do the same. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Cameron reiterated a theme of Monday afternoon&#8217;s debate: distinguishing illegal trusts from legitimate &#8220;unit trusts&#8221; that, he said, are a &#8220;totally legitimate way of investing&#8221; by pension funds and other institutions, among others. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Cameron also told Mr. Robertson that he did not envision adding substantial new sections to the criminal code, beyond his proposal — announced minutes earlier — to punish companies that fail to prevent their employees from illegally avoiding taxes. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Cameron acknowledged to Mr. Robertson that &#8220;for years there was a reputational, and potentially a real, problem&#8221; with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/live/david-cameron-speech/new-steps-to-combat-tax-evasion">Britain&#8217;s dependencies and territories</a> — like the British Virgin Islands — that have been used as tax shelters or havens for money laundering or graver offenses.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">With the overhaul, Mr. Cameron said, Britain&#8217;s territories will by no means be the worst offenders. He said that several states in the United States were even worse. While he did not name any, advocates of financial transparency have long criticized the design of laws in Delaware, Nevada and Wyoming, states often used to incorporate offshore companies and trusts.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Jeremy Corbyn, who was elected last year to lead the opposition Labour Party, has dismissed Prime Minister David Cameron&#8217;s statements as &#8220;a master class in the art of distraction,&#8221; saying the prime minister had done too little, too late to make the wealthy disclose their assets. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;There is now one rule for the superrich and another for the rest,&#8221; said Mr. Corbyn, a hard-left member of Parliament who represents a district in North London. &#8220;How can it be right that street cleaners, teaching assistants and nurses work and pay their taxes, yet some at the top think the rules simply don&#8217;t apply to them?&#8221; </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Corbyn said that Mr. Cameron had yet to answer many questions about his assets and his family&#8217;s holdings in offshore trusts. He said that Britain, under Mr. Cameron&#8217;s Conservative government, had resisted efforts by the European Union to crack down on tax havens.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;The U.K. is at the heart of the global tax avoidance industry,&#8221; Mr. Corbyn said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a national scandal, and it&#8217;s got to end.&#8221; </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He said the government was &#8220;incapable&#8221; of taking serious transnational action against tax avoidance, noting that American companies like Google were pouring money into lobbying efforts in Brussels to protect their large pools of overseas capital from tax collectors.</p>

			<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Britain has been criticized for the role some of its territories — the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, the Isle of Man and the Isle of Jersey — have played as tax shelters.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Prime Minister David Cameron said on Monday that these territories had &#8220;already agreed to exchange taxpayer financial account information automatically,&#8221; starting in September, and that Britain was already going beyond what its counterparts in the Group of 20 advanced economies were doing to combat corruption and opacity.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Cameron announced — perhaps most significantly — a &#8220;new criminal offense&#8221; that will punish corporations &#8220;who fail to prevent their representatives from facilitating tax evasion.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He also said that a government task force, comprising representatives from Revenue and Customs, the Financial Conduct Authority and other bodies, would be set up to examine the releases from the Panama Papers scandal and determine further steps.</p>

			<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain said on Monday that many investment trusts are perfectly legitimate, and urged his colleagues to distinguish between trusts that &#8220;artificially reduce  tax&#8221; and &#8220;those that encourage investment.&#8221; </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Those that encourage investment, he said, are perfectly legal. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He said he had sold his share of his family&#8217;s trust in 2010 — the year his party came to power — &#8220;because I didn&#8217;t want any issues about conflicts of interest,&#8221; and added that he &#8220;didn&#8217;t want anybody to be able to suggest that as prime minister&#8221; he would have any outside interests.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;I accept all of the criticisms,&#8221; he said, for being slow to respond to the Panama Papers disclosures about his father&#8217;s offshore trust. He added that the delay was a result of his strong emotions about what he deemed unfair coverage of his father, Ian, who died in 2010.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;He was a hard-working man and a wonderful dad, and I&#8217;m proud of everything he did to build a business and provide for his family,&#8221; the prime minister said.</p>

			<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Prime Minister David Cameron began the debate on Monday by arguing that existing disclosures rules were sufficient, and stating that he and his top deputy, George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, had been completely transparent. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;Dealing with my own circumstances first, yesterday I published all of the information in my tax returns, not just for the last year but for the last six years,&#8221; he said. He added that he had produced additional information about his salary and inheritances, including his salary; the in-kind benefit from living at 10 Downing Street, the prime minister&#8217;s residence; his and his wife&#8217;s payments as leaders of the Conservative Party; and rental and interest income. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;The publication of the prime minister&#8217;s tax information in this way is unprecedented, but I think it is the right thing to do,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But let me be clear. I’m not suggesting that this should apply to all MPs.&#8221; </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It would be a mistake, he said, to completely abandon taxpayer privacy rights for members of Parliament, as some advocates have suggested.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">His address was greeted with a mix of cheers and jeers, as is common in parliamentary debates, particularly during Prime Minister&#8217;s Questions sessions.</p>

			<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, who has been under pressure after disclosures about an offshore company set up by his father, plans to propose on Monday new criminal penalties for companies that fail to stop their employees from using offshore companies to avoid taxes. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The proposal — opposed by some banks, accounting firms and law firms, which say that the law would hurt London&#8217;s role as a global financial center — is expected to be Mr. Cameron&#8217;s most robust response so far to the Panama Papers scandal, which has exposed vast and secretive holdings of wealth by powerful people around the world.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, is expected to continue pressing Mr. Cameron, arguing that the prime minister has failed to adequately explain his family&#8217;s involvement with offshore tax increases. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland and the leader of the Scottish National Party, published her tax return over the weekend.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">On Monday morning, the government announced that George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, the second most powerful government job after prime minister, would publish his tax returns.</p>
