                        Gave the puzzle to my husband for his birthday around christmas and it turned out he and our 12 year old son were the puzzle fanatics. I was surprised that 'screen boy' enjoyed the puzzle but the gamer in him and us all appreciated the challenge.     Fun gift for all and I loved reading the NYTS in 1963!                    </div>

                        I was embarrassed and disappointed to have given this puzle to my dad for his 90th birthday.  Not only were the articles so tiny and unreadable, but there were hardly any pictures or large headlines on the puzzle.  He had to use a magnifying glass to even put the puzzle together. It was also not the size of a newspaper front page (smaller).  Overall very disappointed.  Certainly not worth the money charged.  Felt cheated.                    </div>

                        I bought the 1000 piece puzzle of the NYT front page for my dad for Christmas.  He is an avid puzzle person and has several grandchildren who share his love.  We always give him a puzzle for Christmas.  This one was extra special because it was his birthdate!  As a history buff, he loved it!  And it was so challenging that it kept everyone busy for hours. He recently told me that it was one of his favorite gifts!                    </div>

                        Never did understand why folks order these for the birthdate. That just tells what happened the day before we were born. We need the next day's paper to know what was happening on the actual dob.                    </div>

                        I ordered 12/12/25 in the 500-piece size for my Dad's 86th birthday. None of us saw what it looked like until he opened it (you get a nifty poster along with the puzzle). Lots and lots of teeny tiny inky words! The puzzle came nicely boxed, the puzzle itself appears to be of good quality, and it came quickly (standard shipping).                      </div>

                        I gave my husband the NYT front page jigsaw (500 pcs.) for the day he was born.  I am pretty sure he never thought he would be interested in a jigsaw puzzle until I opened the box and started to find the outer edges pieces.  We were both  hooked!  Very relaxing and informative.  Lots of fun.  The type clarity could have been better, but overall it was a great gift.                    </div>

                        The words were way too small and blurry on top of it making it nearly impossible to read. I bought the 500 piece puzzle though I'm not sure that 1000 pieces would have made much of a difference. There were much fewer front page pictures in the 20s and 30s so putting the puzzle together just having a cluster of blurry words wan't really what I was expecting.  Overall I think it is a very cute idea and I'm not upset that I tried it but won't buy anymore.                    </div>

                        This puzzle was a Christmas gift.  I opened it today and see that I am going to have quite a challenge solving it.  One thing I would suggest.  There is no mention on the box of the number of pieces or the size.  The size is important to me because I need to know how large a table to start working on.  It will be fun to read all about what was going on in the world on my natal day.                    </div>

                        It was fun to see the print from a news day in the past emerge. However, the jig saw cutter did such a bad job of sawing the print apart that puzzle pieces did not fit together, not even then they contained obvious words, such as NEW YORK TIMES. The puzzle never did lay smooth, even when completed because of the problematic cutting. Don't plan on framing this!                    </div>

                        We have purchased two front page jigsaw puzzles. Both of the puzzles were of good quality in terms of the cuts of the pieces and the clarity of the image. We looked forward to receiving this puzzle, an aerial shot of our North Fork Long Island home. We were disappointed. The color of the pieces on the land area was quite different from the photograph included in the box, making it difficult to complete the puzzle. The product suggests that your vendor is not interested in repeat business.                    </div>

                        Not many people remember what happened in the world the day they were born.  It's probably the shock of living outside the womb for the first time that inhibits memory.  Anyways, I bought the Times Jigsaw Puzzle for a friend on her birthday for the day she was born. She absolutely loved it?

                        This puzzle was done by campers at our August session of Amuuse which is a singles organization. The feedback I had was that it was quite difficult since many sequences could be done in different ways. As a result the pieces had to undone on occasion to find a new link. The amount of dark color and the words also made it a challenge.                    </div>

                        Over all a great idea.  The only thing is that I couldn't review the puzzle that I was purchasing beforehand.  My grandma was born in 1931 and there ended up being no picture on that day.  I was disappointed because she ended up with a black and white puzzle with words only.                      </div>

                        Actually, we are disappointed because the puzzle arrived missing one piece.  It's on the edge, so not very noticeable, but certainly a disappointment, especially considering the cost.                    </div>

                        We purchased a New York Times front page jigsaw puzzle for the date of our wedding in 1977. Bert Lance was the subject of the news on that day. The controversy about him seems quaint now. It was fun to put the puzzle together. We will probably buy another one for a different date.                    </div>

                        Definitely fun/unique.  Older dates are reproduced from microfiche, so they're a bit grainy, but still easy enough to read.  Only issue: puzzle pieces need to vary more.  If you aren't careful, it'll let you fit 2 pieces together that aren't supposed to go together.  Only becomes an issue with the all-white border, is easy to figure out when working w text/pictures.  If that part concerns you, there are other online vendors that provide a 400-piece version that�s a bit better from that aspect.                    </div>

                        I gave the puzzle to my son, who was a History Major in College and he loves it.  He not only enjoys putting it together with his kids, but also reading the front page articles and talking about all of the things with them as well.  It is both a great gift which is fun to put together and has specific value to a special day of celebration.                    </div>

                        The people at The NY Times Store are great.  I errored by ordering a birth date puzzle with the date of 1971 rather than 1981.  They were kind enough to give me a good discount on a replacement puzzle which I ordered for my son.   I went on line and found a prisoner who had the same birth date as the incorrect puzzle in 1971. I sent him the puzzle anonymously.  The NY Times staff made it possible for 2 people to be surprised and puzzled on their birthday!!!!                      </div>

                        I gave two of these puzzles to my sisters, who are in their 70s. They thought it was a really neat idea and one will probably do the same for her children. I would recommend, however, that you make them a little bigger. The print is very hard to read for older eyes.                    </div>

                        I ordered this for my aunt, a former newspaper woman, who turned 100 on June 19th.  The package was wrapped in black (and slightly torn during transit),too gloomy for a birthday present, so we rewrapped before presentation. Upon receipt my aunt pulled out the sample page from the box and promptly said 'the font is too small on this paper.' Then she exclaimed 'it will take me the rest of my life to put this together'.  My cousin laughed and said 'this is a gift that will keep on giving.'                    </div>

                        I purchased this puzzle as a Christmas present fbor my daughter-in-law, an extremely  bright nursing student who loves hard puzzles but doesn't like 3D ones. She absolutely loves it and has begun trying to put it together. She has managed to get the masthead complete but is still working on the main part. She and my son now want to order things for her sisters because of this positive experience. Thank you so much. What a great gift.                    </div>

                        i ordered the NY Times Jigsaw Pizzle for my mother's birthday with the front page from her and my father's wedding date. We love puzzles around the holiday season and this was extra special for her. I chose the 1000 piece puzzle and it was the perfect amount for us. The pieces were well cut, and it was fun to read the articles as we completed it. Highly suggest if you or your loved ones enjoy puzzling!                    </div>

                        The recipient loved it.  I have already recommended it to various friends.  It arrived in no time.  It is harder than I thought it would be. There is included a hard copy of the page represented on the puzzle which certainly helps (for cheaters, anyway.)  I would consider getting the puzzle with only 100 pieces for some situations in the future.                     </div>

                        What could be a better birthday gift for someone who enjoys jigsaw puzzles than a puzzle of the NYT front page from the day you were born?  That's what I thought, so I got it as a gift for a close friend's 60th birthday.  He was happy to have an activity for his whole family to work on while away on vacation -- and nothing that involved electronics!  And I think they were all interested to read the news once the puzzle was complete.  I plan to make this a regular gift purchase.                    </div>

                        I gave this puzzle to my husband as part of a birthday gift, and he absolutely loves it. The puzzle pieces are good quality, and we are finding the 500 pieces to be moderately challenging as we haven't assembled a jigsaw in many years.   The package arrived very quickly and comes in a nice box. Definitely would recommend!                    </div>

                        I bought the Front Page Jigsaw Puzzle for a friend for her 40th birthday, showing the front page of the paper the day she was born. She loved the puzzle and commented specifically on the very nice box that it arrived in. My only negative report is that there was a spot for a dedication in the box, but I did not see an option to write something when I purchased the puzzle online.                    </div>

                        I purchased this item for my father's 60th birthday. Obviously, when shaking the box this gift is a puzzle, but what he didn't know was what the puzzle was. When he opened it is reaction was &quot;oh wow, this is so cool&quot;. I think this is a great gift for any age group. Personally, i would choose a milestone birthday, but it will definitely be remembered. what i really like, is that growing up my father and I truly enjoyed doing puzzles together so this was the perfect gift!                    </div>

                        The 1000 piece puzzle is far too difficult for most, even my very very accomplished father - I had hope the Cover News Page would help but the print is sooooo small and of course it is all black and white - gave this as a gift to my 80 year old father but it is just sitting in the closet.

                        We gave this puzzle to my 91-year-old dad and his wife of ten years, dated the day the two of them met.  He's the real jigsaw puzzle worker, but she, too, loved the present.  Once he'd finished it, they sprayed some fixative on it and are planning to have it framed so they can hang it in their den.  I don't know what my dad learned about what happened in NYC on October 11, 2001, but he loves the puzzle!                    </div>

                        Great gift for the guy who is interested in everything, loves to read the newspaper, &amp; loves a good challenge. This was a hit.  The printed page is a great companion to the puzzle, super quick delivery, and the fun of putting it together all 1000 pieces will be long lasting.  Thanks NYTStore                    </div>

                        A little different than most puzzles because there was not much variation in the shape of the pieces. He needed to use the included actual front page  to sew what letter goes next to the adjacent letter. Took im a month of part time effort. He rated it7/10 in difficulty.

                        I ordered the jigsaw puzzle with the wrong date and called immediately to make a change request. They confirmed it would be changed but then I began to receive email confirmations with the old date. I received 2-3 of these incorrect confirmations before I had to call again to ensure the correct item was being received. This was just a communication issue between what customer service was aware of and what I was getting via email.                    </div>
