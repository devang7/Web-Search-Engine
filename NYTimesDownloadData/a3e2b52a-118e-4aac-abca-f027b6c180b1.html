                        Seems like NYT is using an inconsistent printer for these orders. I ordered one for my son's birthday a few years ago and it was beautifully done, just ordered a second one for my daughter's birthday and it wasn't even in color despite being after 1998. I called and they are looking into it, assume it was just a mistake at the printer, but based on prior review comments, I would call customer service if you think you got a crappy print. They are definitely capable a great ones.                    </div>

                        I ordered a Times front page of 80 years ago to add to the celebration of the 80th Birthday of a relative.  She loved it, as well as the poem I wrote based on the events of that day, as shown on that front page.      These authentic front pages are a wonderful way to add tribute to a birthday celebration.  thanks for making them available!                    </div>

                        I ordered a reprint for my parents 60th wedding anniversary. While the print was small it was clear and readable. Great packaging and quick delivery. Hard to find a stock frame at 11 x 17 so I should have ordered it framed. It was a big hit. A very satisfied customer.                    </div>

                        I purchased two prints and then framed them myself. They were a gift to my boyfriend for the day we met and our anniversary. Its fun because I can add prints as more important dates happen. Plus is a gift to remind him of us without screaming mushy mushy.     I am very happy with the quality of the print. Great color!    The only bummer is that you can view the page for a certain date. I would have like that option.                     </div>

                        I wanted something special for a lady celebrating her 100th Birthday. This certainly fitted the occasion. She loved it!  I only regret not getting the framed reprint instead of just the print since her family is getting it framed at her request. She will always connect us with it because we are her only friends from New York.   Thank you, New York Times!                    </div>

                        What do you get as a present for a ninety year old? Answer - a front page reprint of the New York Times for the day they were born.  Everyone thought it was a very unique gift. I needed it in a week. It was delivered in 2 or 3 days. I even had time to shop for a frame at K-Mart. It was a big hit.                    </div>

                        My wife loved her birthday front page from the New York Times.  However, it was explained that the news from your specific day is usually reported the next day.  Ok, fine.  But, if I order the 25th of July, 1961, I expect to get the newspaper with the date on it of 25th of July, 1961 not the 26th.  Other than that, everything was great.                    </div>

                        I was a little underwhelmed when I received this, since of course it's a reproduction and smaller than the actual paper size (I ordered the smaller of the two sizes). But my father was really delighted with it when I gave it to him for his 70th birthday. He read all of the news items and we discussed them as a family, and he said he'd always wanted one. So I was very happy in the end with the purchase!                    </div>

                        My husband and I chose to honor the 'traditional' wedding anniversary gifts suggestions and knew that year one (paper)would certainly be challenging. Since my husband is an avid reader of many different news outlets, I thought he would love the reprint of the front page of the NY Times. Of course, the reprint is from our Wedding date.  He loved it!  It looks absolutely beautiful and we are happy to hang it in our home.                      </div>

                        My husband and have been together for 8 years, but we celebrated our first wedding anniversary this past October and wanted to do something special.  We decided to give &quot;traditional&quot; gifts, with the 1st year being paper. Getting the reprint on the day of our wedding was an awesome time capsule!  I bought a frame from a separate vendor due to the cost, but the newspaper itself was beautiful!  I highly recommend this as a gift for sentimental people looking for something original to give.                    </div>

It would be an embarrassment to give this as a gift. I found it shocking  to believe that anyone would sell an item of such poor quality.When I called the seller, they were rude and unresponsive. They referred to the item a personalized. It has no name on the copy, only a date.                     </div>

                        While i liked the idea of buying the front page reprint for a 90 year old,  note that the print is REALLY small - much smaller than a typical newspaper print because it has to be shrunk to size.  Very hard for me to read, much less a 90 year old :)  On the other hand, still a cool idea for a present....                    </div>

                        Perhaps if you get a newer digital version, they come out nice. I got one for my dad's birthday from 1941. It was very small print and looked like a low quality photo copy. Still a nice gift, but not for $40. I'm glad I didn't pay the extra money for a framed one.     By the way, I love how when I go to write the review, the NYT site automatically defaults to 5 stars unless I actually change it!! Wonder how many people have forgotten to change the rating?                    </div>

                        I gave this as a gift to my 95 year old grandfather. It was the front page on the day he was born. The print was sooo small that I could barely read it so unfortunately it meant nothing to him since he could not read anything on the page. Waste of money.                     </div>

                        The product was okay.   A bit disappointing in some regards.  I thought I was purchasing a color reproduction and what arrived was black and white.  The print quality wasn't great -- almost low res - not crisp and clear.  The frame was nice.  The recipient seemed to like the gift, but I wouldn't buy this product again.                     </div>

                        Great concept (and money maker, no doubt).  My only suggestion (read complaint) is that, for what you charge, you should be using a more appropriate paper stock. The finished product should look a bit &quot;old&quot;. Consider using slightly yellowed or aged paper, not so old as people could claim &quot;fraud&quot;, but something darker than pure white.  Either that or you could include instructions as to how to age the paper. Any number of ways can be found on the internet.                     </div>

                        I did the same with a Danish newspaper Berlingske Tidende. Their option was less expensive, and did not involve flying the front page to Monaco. They sent a link with the front page with the actual colour of the paper as well (not just white on white like the NYT), and all I had to do was get it printed and laminated. They did not have to fly it over and it was easy. I suggest the NYT should do the same. Making me pay $50 to transport it by Fed Ex really does not make sense.                    </div>

                        Re:     We were disappointed that the front page that we ordered was not on newsprint.  We thought that for $85 (with shipping) we would get something a little more authentic than what appeared to just be a photocopy.  I could have done that myself using my public library and Kinkos, for about $5.00.       So, no, we weren't satisfied.  Thought we were getting a more realistic front page, especially given that we were buying it directly from the New York Times.     Kathleen Alperin                    </div>

                        I was incredibly disappointed by this.  The idea is great and I wish the follow through lived up to the expectation.  It looks like it was printed on cards stock from an ink jet printer.  The clarity was poor. Overall it was nowhere near the money spent.  I really wish it was well executed, it would have been a phenomenal gift.                    </div>

                        Nice gift to give, well framed, shipping is blazing fast. Unfortunately the print itself is tiny. Pictures of reprints on the website show prints close to the edge of the mat. Mine had a whopping 3.2� wasted white space on the top/bottom and almost 2� wasted space on the sides. The mat was more wasted space so why waste more on the print? No one could read it without getting very close. It's not &quot;defective&quot; so I can't return it. Not sure I'd do the 11x17 as it really is less than 8.5 x 12.5.                    </div>

                        This the second NY Times Front Page reprint I have purchased. It looks great, the framing is excellent quality and each reprint arrived right on schedule. I can't think of a better significant birthday (such as 50, 65, etc.)gift. It is educational, historical and memorable. And it even holds its own hanging next to original artworks.                    </div>

                        because it's so greatly reduced in size the font/type is very small- can hardly read it. perhaps with these older (100 years) reprints that should be made particularly clear in the description or a larger format offered.    packaging is very nice.                    </div>

                        We were told that &quot;no presents&quot; were expected.  The NY Times front page reprint was not a present, it was their history, of their day. It was fun to read about stories that were current then and they had gone to the NY Worlds Fair on they honeymoon which made it even more special. I would recommend this as a gift for birthdays and anniversaries.                    </div>

                        My Great Aunt Grace celebrated her 100th birthday on March 14, 2014. One of the many gifts was a framed copy of the a replica of the front page of the New York Times for March 14, 1914. She was born before the start of World War I. The celebration was held at a Knights of Columbus Hall so many people were present. That gift was passed around the crowd. It was certainly was a unique gift.                    </div>

                        I was unhappy with the quality of the copy as it was slightly blurred in the lower left quadrant  with some foggy kind of dots.  NYT customer service said that was due to the quality of the front page.  I had expected that an archival copy would have been used for photocopies. I could have gotten the same result by going to the local library and printing it myself.                      </div>

                        Disappointed with the reprint we received of the front page of the NYT. The framing is beautiful, but last time I framed a front page of the NYT I took it to a framery and did the actual paper from the day. I thought I would recevie the same as I ordered the day of the paper not an old paper. Instead I received a reprint - essentially a xerox of the paper. not what I wanted.                    </div>

                        I felt the quality and clarity was very poor. A drug store copy machine has better quality. I was very disappointed and did not give this as a gift as planned.   I will not purchase this type of product again in the future.  It's too bad , as I was excited to have this as a 50 th Birthday gift.  Oh well! I                    </div>

                              I gave a reprint of the NY Times front page of the date of birth as a 50th birthday gift. It was the perfect gift for a history buff who can also buy himself anything he wants.  Awesome, was the response I received.                    </div>

                        My son was born on the day the astronauts landed on the moon. I ordered the front page dated one day later - the day that the moon landing was announced by NYT. It was quite meaningful for me and my son enjoyed receiving the framed page for Christmas. Thank you very much for an anjoyable remembrance.                    </div>
