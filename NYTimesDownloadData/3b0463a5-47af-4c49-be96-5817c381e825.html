                        We got this for my father in law for his 80th birthday. He is so hard to shop for. He LOVED this! We couldn't be more pleased. It has extra pages, a magnifier sheet, and a coin and it comes in a heavy decorative box. He is loving going through all of the years. This is a fabulous gift for that hard to buy for person.  Furthermore, customer service was great. When I expressed concern about the time (Dec) Customer service advised that the vendor was working around the clock and guaranteed delivery by 12/23 end of day. Sure enough, fed ex delivered. Totally satisfied with the entire transaction/product. Well done!                    </div>

                        This is a perfect gift to give someone who has celebrated a long life.  He/she will be able to reminisce about what happened in the past and see how it has impacted the present and the future.  This is definitely an opportunity to do something different and outside the box.                    </div>

                        Great purchase-a gift for my stepdad. He enjoyed reading the headlines of his birth date over the years and was surprised to see how much had happened. There were a few articles he wished he could read in their entirety since only the front page is included, but Google helped out with learning more about those topics. The icing on the cake was the free 3- month subscription to NY Times online that came free with the book.                    </div>

                        While the photocopies of front pages are a good gift, the quality of the binder is poor.  One binder arrived with a defective screw so that it was not even attached.  We had to go to the hardware store to find a proper one to fix.  I certainly was disappointed to give this as a gift, and will never do so again!                    </div>

I've seen the more basic version, and you can't compare. . . the ultimate birthday book has a much richer feel and presence, and it makes quite a statement. Being a news aficionado, I know he's going to love it. I can't wait to give it to him!                    </div>

                        My dad was delighted when he opened the box with this book in it and immediately began to read it. The binding was beautiful with his name embossed on it. It came with a handy magnifying glass because the print is pretty tiny. I would recommend this to anyone who is difficult to buy for- they will enjoy this unique gift!                    </div>

                        the content in the book was nice, but the leather binder itself was of poor quality.  There were air bubbles on the front cover and the name card on the front also fell out of place and had to be re-glued.                     </div>

                        It was my father's 80th birthday. He is very hard to buy a present for or even present a unique experience. I asked him if he would like to stay in a yurt. &quot;Oh I have already done that honey - one night in Kyrgyzstan with an ex-KGB agent drinking shots of vodka. But good try.&quot; He LOVED this present - The TIMES of YOUR LIFE -birthday book. He stopped eating his birthday cake and couldn't put the book down. It was a home run! And that is not easy to do with him :)                    </div>

                        Bought for my 84 year old Father in Law. He never thought he would live so long, and he is just really enjoying every day he is alive, and is reaching out for knowledge which this book gives to him in a format which works.  The magnifier is a nice touch, and I got him a larger one, also.  The book also works for general year by year for his Wife, as she is younger.  Great gift, and I would highly recommend it.                    </div>

Thought that since it is now 2014 , you should have included the first decade of this century of this decade. Print quality of older issues make it difficult to read even with the magnifier.                    </div>

                        It was my brother's 40th birthday.  What a great gift to get someone who is particular, doesn't really need anything, but you would like to give something special.  It is a wonderful mile marker gift.  To see the headlines on your special day is fun.  I love that there is room for photos and notes.  The presentation is beautiful and the box it comes in is a gift in itself.  Love, love.  What's more is he loved it.  Thank you!                    </div>

                        The gift was a winner! The receiver was over whelmed! Several guest at 80th party order one for themselves the next day!  The Executive son asked if okay to order for some of his best clients?  I deserve a commission for all the referrals!

It is a Royal gift.                    </div>

It is attractively and elegantly bound, and the personalization is a nice touch. He was delighted with it, and enjoyed reading about the year when he was born. I know he will get a lot of enjoyment from this book. And the ability to add subsequent years is a plus. An excellent gift.                    </div>

                        I ordered the Ulltimate Birthday Book for my 82-year old mother with instructions not to open until Christmas. Around December 18 she called me to tell me it was the best gift she had gotten for Christmas since I sent her to Italy 20 years ago.  She said it was bringing back a lot of important memories of things she hadn't thought about in years, and she was especially impressed that the Times was sold for 2 cents a copy in 1928.                    </div>

                        Got it for Mom's 80th.  I came with everything advertised.  The type was quite readable but I'm sure Mom will appreciate the included magnifier.  It was very interesting to leaf through and I enjoyed spending time with it myself.  But it costs a lot and includes a NY Times medallion and I can't imagine why anyone would want that.  It seems to be a way to just pump up the price.                    </div>

                        We bought this for a friend's 75th birthday.  Like many men he has everything and is challenging to buy for.  Of course, he didn't have this and it made a lovely gift.  He spent hours reading every paper and was really delighted with it.  The quality of the book and embossing was great and it includes a large flat magnifier to make the pages easier to read.  Highly recommend!!                    </div>

                        This gift greatly exceeded my expectations.  I bought it for my father, for his 77th birthday.  It is a beautiful, high quality book, that arrived very nicely packaged and came with a magnifier for easier viewing.  I wasn't quite sure what it would be like, but am so happy to have taken the risk.  My dad loves it, and has spent many hours perusing the pages.  He says it brings back memories of many events he wouldn't otherwise have thought of.  Will definitely keep this in mind for others!                    </div>

                        My brother was delighted with the Times of Your Life.  The book is beautifully put together and packaged, with several nice extras, including the history timeline. It's a tabletop book people will actually read and remember.  And the more years of history you've lived through, the more pages you get.

                        Gift for my dad's 80th birthday. My only complaint is that the reproductions are smaller than I expected - so the print is impossibly tiny. Other than that great - and very prompt and accurate customer service. Great for people who wait until the last minute.                     </div>

I highly recommend it for people who enjoy the news and understanding their place in history.   Print is on the small side but that is understandable considering the need to fit the entire front page of a newspaper onto a book page that is considerably smaller.                     </div>

                        I purchased this book for my father who was turning 60 and he hasn't stopped raving about it. He says it is a once and a lifetime gift. As a lawyer and a judge originally from NYC, it's hard to find the &quot;right&quot; gift.  Well, this birthday book was it.  He is taking his time spending hours reading each page carefully and strolling back through memory lane.  My father also noted the quality of the book and gift box too.  Thanks again.

                        I purchased this for my mom when she turned 70, and she couldn't have been more happy. It was like a birthday gift for her, all of her friends, children, and grandchildren. It was a family affair for weeks. I was surprised how attentive the children and grandchildren were listening to my mother and her friends pouring over each page, reminiscing, and talking about events they recalled. It was clearly the best present ever, and everyone should have one.                     </div>

                        I ordered this product online to be shipped directly to the gift recipient. I even called to confirm that it would be sent to his address, not mine, but it still showed up on my doorstep, requiring me to pay additional to ship it to the right person. The print is EXTREMELY small, so if you are giving this as a gift, you might also buy a magnifying glass so they can read it. Otherwise, it's a very interesting gift and is nicely packaged.                    </div>

                        I bought the Ultimate Birthday book for my mother's 75th, after seeing one at a friend's house.  It is such a terrific gift.  It presents beautifully and is fascinating to look through.  My mother absolutely loved it -- she was really impressed by the beautiful packaging and the gift itself.  I'm going to get another for a second friend's birthday.                    </div>

                        I gave this book to my Mom for her 85th birthday.  It was the perfect gift, especially since she's a retired Journalism professor who worked as an intern at the Times as a young college graduate.  She enjoys looking at a page from different years and remembering where she was in her life at that time.    Great gift, especially for the senior crowd.                    </div>

                        Wonderful gift for an 89 year old and was so happy to find the magnifier at the back of the book. I was thinking about buying one as I leafed through all the pages and then voila there it was. It was a big hit. The only thing I was not happy with was that it was packaged in the shipping box which was inappropriate for gift wrapping. I made due using tissue and then my wrap but I think it would have been nicer with better box or sleeve, inside the brown cardboard one.                    </div>

I also like the well thought out summary and inserts at the end, so we can keep adding pages for years to come.  The magnifier, too, is a nice touch!                    </div>

                        This book makes a very handsome and special gift and is a lot of fun, but quite expensive. It's also probably the best gift you'll find for someone who is 95 years old. The commemorative coin that is comes with is silly - wish they would omit it and save the customer a couple bucks.                        </div>

                        I purchased this for my 84 year old mother who is always talking about the changes she has witnessed in her lifetime. She LOVED recieving this book! Everyone else has also enjoyed it. Its really awesome seeing actual newpaper coverage of events so far in the past. My mom has enjoyed sharing the events of her lifetime with all of us. This is such a great gift especially for an elderly person. The book came amazingly quick after placing the order.                      </div>

I am from Australia and when i gifted this great book to our uncle he was amazed at all the events he could look back on and remember and learn to know, this is a greatly presented and thought out gift. Will be purchasing this for a lot more friends and family.  Thanks to the New York Times.  Nik                    </div>

She thought it was a unique gift and I concur! I always say that it is not necesesarily about the expensive, but rather the exclusive. This Ultimate Birthday Book fits the bill!                    </div>

He has been dealing with health issues and had been inside and feeling a little cooped up. He LOVED the book..it gave him something to keep him busy and actively engaged since the book was a recap of the events that have made up his 83 years. I will be sure to keep adding pages to help him continue to celebrate his wonderful LONG life!                    </div>

                        I am generally happy with this purchase. There was one problem, however. On the cover there is a gold embossed leather name plate which sits in a window in the cover of the book.  The name plate was not attached securely and had slipped diagonally out of place. Luckily I was able to repair the error. If I had sent it directly I wouldn't have been happy when they opened it.  Overall, this is a good present.                      </div>

                        I gave my Mom the Ultimate Birthday Book - &quot;The Times of Your Life&quot; and it was gorgeous and breathtaking.  The gift is hugely personal and memorable on the one hand and has amazing production values on the other hand (blue leather, embossed lettering).  While not inexpensive it is a remarkable value for money.  You can't go wrong with this gift!                    </div>

                        My husband and I gave this book as a sixtieth birthday present to someone pretty difficult to buy for . After all, by the time were sixty we've usually acquired more things then we need!   We recieved the item in just 2 days, and I was so happy with the quality.  It was beautiful !  Needless to say, my brotherinlaw loved it!   Very happy we found this unique gift.                     </div>

                        John was born on Aug 7, 1945, the day after the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. He has always had the front page of the NYT framed from Aug 7, 1945 and found it fascinating. He was thrilled to receive the front page of the NYT for the past 66 years. It was absolutely the perfect gift for any one who likes and appreciates history.    It is not often that I come across such a perfect gift that has meaning,is educational and shows someone you really care.    gail                    </div>

                        Purchased this for my Grandma's 90th birthday.  She loved it!! As her family, we were thrilled to get her something she didn't already have. However, shipping it on time was stressful since 1) Next day delivery only means it will ship the next day..not be delivered 2)the shipping reps kept trying to ship it after her birthday so the insert would be included.  This would have left us emptyhanded for her birthday party.                    </div>

                        Great present for the right person&amp;the  right occasion.I received this as a gift so I knew about it. It's an impressive gift&amp;one that will be displayed&amp;kept for a lifetime. I gave 2 since getting mine&amp;was pleased to get a good discount via e mail. It's expensive&amp;also so oversized which I guess it has to be to read the print,but it's hard to find a good place for it b/c of the size. Especially good for regular NY Times readers! I love mine &amp; read a page a week &amp; will probably give it again.                    </div>

                        I'm so excited about this gift.  My father will be 70 this year and he was born the day after Pearl Harbor was bombed.  He has visited the memorial several times and has a keen interest in all things related to the attack.  I'm sure the annual pages will have coverage of anniversary events regarding the attack, as well as, the normal events associated with each passing year.  Can't wait and I know he'll love it!                    </div>

                        My gift was for a friend in Hong Kong and the package was really nice including the commemorative coin.  Personally I think the entire copy of the Times would be a better choice.  What we want to see is how people were living - the ads, the local news and that was missing from the front page book.  Still it was a nice gift and well received.                     </div>

He is the man who has everything and he's so hard to buy for.  I know he was thrilled with the book and couldn't wait to show all his friends!  Thanks for such an awesome product!                    </div>

                        I just gave this to my Dad for his 80th birthday and it was a big hit. It was interesting, attractive, and we all enjoyed looking at it. What else do you give someone at that point in their lives? This was perfect. p.s. If you want to give it to someone on their birthday, you won't have the page from the actual birthday itself because it won't have come out yet. However, for about $20 you can get that page sent later, designed to be added to the book.                    </div>

                        My 90 year-old mother has dementia, but not so much so she cannot enjoy 90 years of New York Times front pages. The print is quite small and while the Times includes a magnifyer, it isn't sufficient. You will likely need something more. Hours of pleasure, and as my mother has said often, it is a history book, one worth the time.                    </div>

                        The book makes a wonderful keepsake to celebrate a special occasion, e.g., birthday, anniversary. My only negative would be that, when we purchased this book two years ago, I remember it being available at a considerably lesser price without the coin.  I hope that the Times would consider this option for the future.                    </div>

                        I bought this for my aunt's 95th birthday. It was very impressive. Rven the box was beautiful and didn't need wrapping.

                        I thought New York Times Ultimate Birthday Book would make a perfect and different gift for my husband Bill (we are NYT fanatics). When he opened the gift he was absolutely delighted, I think more by the classy elegant presentation than for the actual facts it contained (I was more impressed by the 53 years of news). For people that actually read well written news and for people that have respect for a stylish presentation I highly recommend it.                    </div>

                        very nicely bound, packaged, well thought out. Some of the reproduction was not the best-muddy and very dark photo's, hard to read print.  It was a gift for my 90 year old father, he liked it a lot. A half page magnifier would probably help with reading it instead of the smaller one that was included.                    </div>

                        This is a great idea. The headlines are readable and enjoyable. Unfortunately, the print is really small, so even using the little print enlarger, it is really hard to see. My father will enjoy the headlines. Just wish he could actually see more of the articles. The binding and personalizing are very nice.                    </div>

In fact we have decided to make it a traditional gift for our close friends on a big year.  The order was placed and received within 24 hours. What fabulous service!                    </div>

                        The Ultimate Birthday Book is just that: The ultimate birthday present that won't just sit on the shelf. The only problem is you might not want to give it up to its intended recipient. At least I didn't. But common sense prevailed, and my friend loved paging through it.     The quality is excellent. This is not a scrapbook that will start to flake apart over the years. And there is space to add your own NYT front pages over succeeding years.                      </div>

                        Grandpa was delighted with his 90th Birthday Book and flipped through it with many of his friends recalling and reliving events they have experienced since 1921!  Each guest wrote a personal message in the Autograph section of the book.  We added newspaper clippings and photos in the back too.  Truly a successful gift for a wonderful man.  I am sure he will cherish it always.  Thank you!                    </div>

                        What a great way to look back on your life!  Seeing the news stories from each year brings back other memories of what was going on in your life each year and what you were doing.  I'd forgotten many of the stories, but the book was a fantastic way to take a nostalgic journey into the past.  Love it!                    </div>

                        Our lab reviewed several gift suggestions for a landmark birthday gift to our professor, and decided upon the Ultimate Birthday Book.  We anticipated that production would take a few days so, along with a prototype, added a few phrases from the NYT website and some of our own we made a mock-up of our gift to him.  A few days later the book had arrived in time for another celebration for him.  Everyone loved it!!                     </div>

                        The front pages from a specific date in 1981 and forward was a HUGE hit. It was a gift to a couple born on the same day and year and they were simply thrilled.

                        I gave this to a 60 year old who absolutely loves the NYT so it was a hit.  It was presented at his birthday dinner in Las Vegas with lots of friends and family and they were excited about this gift idea.  Now we're thinking of doing it for my father's 85th.                      </div>

                        I bought this for my son's 30th birthday.  He loved it because it was so unique.  Everyone at the party spent time looking at the book.  It was a great conversation starter.  As much as this was a great gift, it's probably more suitable for an older receipent, (more pages).  However, it is so well done and very professional looking.  I will be ordering this again for other favorite people!                    </div>
