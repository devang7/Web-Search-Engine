                        I gave this gift to my father and he really loved it!  The ONLY thing I would say could be better is that the type is very small (not a problem), but the magnifying glass that comes with the book is not very good.  I would suggest buying a real magnifying glass if you purchase this gift.  Still, a wonderful gift!                    </div>

I had forgotten that people dressed much more formally then than today.  And new shirts for $5?  Much is the same as 1963 but much is different.                      </div>

                        My brother is a bit self-indulgent, so it's hard to think of a gift for him that he hasn't already bought for himself.  The New York Times edition from the day he was born was a HUGE hit!  He's kind of a history buff and really enjoyed reading the news of the day, and also seeing how the ads, and the newspaper itself, has changed.  He'll really get a lot of enjoyment out of it.  I recommend this to anyone who has a special date in their past -- totally fun.                    </div>

We have all enjoyed looking at it- especially my college age sons who have even taken photos of some of the ads and headlines.  I'm sorry I hadn't thought of it before for those 'milestone' birthday gifts.                     </div>

                        I ordered the Special Day Book for my older brother's 70th Birthday. I was very impressed when it came. It was nicely put together, and had a classy look and feel to it. When I gave it to him, he was quite surprised and really enjoyed it. It was a perfect fit especially since he is a retired newspaper reporter. Thanks.                     </div>

                        These are amongst those things you read again and again. The year (1943) was one that set the rest of the 20th Century and, in the midst of rationing, even the ads were interesting. This New York Times product was professional, enjoyable and something I look forward to giving again.                    </div>

                        I ordered this item for my dad after reading about it in the SkyMall magazine.  It was a huge hit and cheaper by $10 off the NYTimes website.  My dad loved reading about the events during his birthday, but also the headlines from 150 years of US History.  A great gift!                    </div>

                        I purchased this as a birthday gift for my Father.  He loves it!  It's proudly displayed on a book stand and has been enjoyed by everyone who visits.  His 15 year old grandson likes to leaf through it, to see what life was like when his Grampa was born.      Hands down, this is the best gift I've ever come across.    As a side-note, I ordered this from Canada and received it in 3 business days - amazing!  I cannot rave about this item enough.                    </div>

                        I bought the Special Day Book for my father's 90th birthday and his eye went immediately to the advertisements and classified ads where he could see familiar hotels and resorts that he visited with his parents, what things cost in 1922, etc.  Many of the ads were for businesses that are no longer in business so it was fun seeing him reminisce.

                        There aren't many presents that carry a personal connection.  The NY Times issue of an exact birthday is one that makes people smile broadly in appreciation. What's more fun than seeing what was happening in the world on the day you were born? The older a person is, the more magical the gift is because of the distance of that day's paper.                      </div>

                        What a wonderful way to celebrate someone's milestone birthday (we gave one to my dad &amp; father-in-law for their 80th birthdays) or anniversary. It's been fun for our entire family to read the articles, look at the styles, fashions, advertisements of the 1930's.

He picks it up and peruses it often. It was a definite success!                    </div>

                        My Grandma wanted to send her nephew a super special gift for his 71st birthday so we send the New York Time Special Day Book (totally out of her budget) because she adored him.  Grandma passed away 4 weeks later.    I'm so glad that she made the decision to do something extraordinarily special for Uncle Anthony.  He loves it and will forever treasure this last gift from my Grandma.  Thank you.                    </div>

I, as the buyer, was a little dismayed to find out that only a few days after purchasing the book, you were offering discounts and free shipping. Your quick turn around time on the book would have allowed me to wait to order the book until the discounts were offered had I been told this when I called to inquire. I felt slightly taken advantage of.                    </div>

                        Ordered the book version of the paper from the day my dad was born in 1937. He loved it and I am impressed with it. It is so cool to see the stories and ads from back then. Imagine, a suit for $20. And I remember some of the stories from local history. I highly recommend this as a gift, or for yourself.                    </div>

                        I purchased 3 birthday books and the recipients were delighted with them as was I when I looked through them.  The clothing add and classifieds were fun to look at, and they also enjoyed looking at theatre and movies if the year.  I was especially interested in the 1956 book's pieces on the racial situation of the time.  To see mention of the Alabama Citizen's Council was a reminder of bad times.  I would recommend these books to other.                    </div>

                        I ordered burgundy and it came in blue. Pages are too small to read and are simply minimum quality reprints. Binding is weak and fragile, and I don't expect it to last more than one or two turns of page flipping. An interesting novelty gift but not the quality I had assumed and not the right color I ordered.                    </div>

                        I ordered this for a friend because he had been recognized in an article in the NY edition. I called before ordering to confirm that the book would be printed from the NY edition. I was told it would be. The gift arrived without the article in it. It was printed from the national edition. customer service did nothing to resolve this--I would have expected way more from the nytimes.                     </div>

                        I wound not recommend this as a gift, or as a purchase . The print is so small that even with the magnifying device, it's nearly impossible to read. This was a gift for a 90 year old! I think it should be specified that the print is extremely small. Perhaps I was at fault not realizing that the paper would be a machine copy. I have ordered such papers in the past and received the original paper.Secondly, I expected a gift card, not my congratulatory not on the pkg slip!                      </div>

                        I recently purchased the Your Special Day Book as a gift and I was very happy with it. It arrived very well packed and in a beautiful NYTimes photographic box. Inside, the book itself is lovely, beautifully monogrammed and although the print is small, the included magnifier works just fine. I also enjoyed the essays at the end of the book, an added bonus. A great gift!                     </div>

                        I ordered this book for my sister for her 70th birthday. She really loved it. However, I thought I was ordering the book with the front pages from every birthday since birth. I was disappointed but she didn't know. I never noticed that there were two options for the book. Maybe you should combine them into a birthday book selection with 2 options. That way there will be no question. So, I give the book a 4 star rating, but the ordering procedure in this case a 1 or less.                     </div>

                        I purchased this book as a gift for my Mother who turns 80 years old this December.  The finished product presents very well with her name and birthdate engraved on the front.  It is a unique gift to memorialize her year of birth.  The only problem may be with the print size which is a bit small for 80 year old eyes.  Overall though, very happy with the purchase.                    </div>

                        I was originally thinking of ordering this through Hammacher Schlemmer but it turned out it would have taken far too long for a deadline I had. So I called up NY times store directly and they processed my order immediately. They shipped the following day and it arrived in plenty of time, well packed and presentable. The recipient was thrilled, as was I. Will definitely order again for other folks!                    </div>

                        I ordered this book to give to my sister as a 70th birthday gift.  I knew it was not a practical gift but I feel a 70th birthday deserves something unique.  The book is beautifully bound and I love it.  I especially liked the magnifying sheet included.  I enjoyed reading the articles (it was during WW 2) and the adds that gave prices for food stuffs and clothing items.  I'm sure my sister will love it.                    </div>

                        I got a hard bound copy of the NY Times for the date of my Dad's birth. This was a gift for his 85th birthday.  He seems to be getting a kick out of it and I have enjoyed looking at it, too.  It came beautifully bound with his name on the front in gold letters and the date in gold, also.  And it only took 2 - 3 days for Dad to get it after I ordered it. I am very pleased with the quality of the book and the rapid delivery and the ease of the ordering process!                    </div>

                        I ordered this book for my husband's 60th Birthday, after reading the positive reviews, and felt it would be something very special for him.  The outside of the book is well done, and like the personalization, however, but when I opened the first page and saw that the print was so tiny that you couldn't even read it, I was aghast.  I had just paid $100 , I felt I had been majorly ripped off.  Save your money                          </div>

                        I ordered a 1944 NYTimes with the recipients birthday and name embossed on the cover.  Whereas I received the proper paper, the embossed cover was totally wrong.

                        This was the perfect gift!  We didn't know what to get our grandmother for her 90th Birthday.   We scored big time with this.  It was so neat to see the advertisements from this time period.  This book was binded in a quality hardback cover.  The personalization on front was nicely done and really made the gift seem that much more expensive.  I ended up ordering another one for my father for Christmas.  I've had other family members hint that they would love this for a gift as well.                     </div>

                        I bought the item for my mom�s 65th birthday.  She LOVED it!!!!!  She couldn�t sleep whole night because she wanted to know what happened around the world on the day she was born.  My husband and brother-in-law thought it was an excellent gift idea.  Nevertheless, I felt NY times could have done better job in binding and packaging.  It�s an expensive gift and I think NY Time should have done a better job in those two points so that it doesn�t look like a $20 gift item.                               </div>

                        I purchased the special day book for my uncle on his 100th birthday  celebration.  My uncle absolutely loved the book.  The packaging and presentation were very tasteful.      The gift was a last minute thought and the  staff expedited my purchase so that my uncle would receive the gift on time. Reba and her supervisor Georgeanne went well beyond what was expected of them to help take my uncle down memory lane. I was very impressed with  the service as well as the product.                    </div>

                        #1 the cover was the only impressive part of this gift. there was very little (beyond ads) that reflected 9/1/1922.even with &quot;magnifier&quot; what little there was was far too small.i would think that if putting together a fair representation of the nyt for that period was so limited you would not offer it.perhaps more current issues provide more to work with but my mom's was sooo lame.so disappointing for such a special occasion.NO STARS RATING NOT LISTED BELOW                      </div>

                        The NYTimes book of the day my dad was born was highly anticipated. The disappointment came when you opened it and the type was so so small, even with the poor magnifier included it was so hard to read. As a birthday present for an 80th birthday it was disappointing. Even these 50 year old eyes struggled.                    </div>

                        The bound paper for the day we were married in 2011, was exquisitely put together (minus distortion of the actual newspaper pages which was a little surprising). The gilded and transparent paper in the front and the embossed cover were perfect for my anniversary gift. Howevr, I agreed to do this review because the woman who took my order went above and beyond to help me get the book to the shipping address in time, saving my anniversary.

                        We agree the NY TIMES should warn customers about this. It's a great idea that�s nearly impossible to interact with due to the tiny print size (5pt font?) Upon opening the book all of our enthusiasm just evaporated into awkward silence, with the person whose birthday gift it was having to contrive unfelt expressions of interest. The magnifier isnt strong enough to make for comfortable reading either. We feel cheated. After all it would be easy to include a life-size image on the web page.                    </div>
