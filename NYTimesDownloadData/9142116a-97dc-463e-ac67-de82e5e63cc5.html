The names that you can put on the map is a nice touch but the quality of the printing was just o.k. could of been better, this is the reason for the 4 star rating,   Don't hesitate to buy, it makes a wonderful gift to that someone who loves to travel!!                    </div>

                        If our product would not have come damaged I would for sure give this product 5 stars.  The frame was broken in our upper left corner but we decided to keep it and repair it ourselves because the return process was too complex and would cost us more money.  I looked long and hard at all different types of these maps and this one is by far my favorite!                     </div>

                        Our journeys have taken us far and wide so I bought this for my husband's birthday.  Everyone who has seen it loves it and it is amazing how many people stop to look at it- print maps are something people rarely see these days.  Great quality in the map and framing.  Also delivered very quickly with packaging that insured it arrived in perfect condition.  Great purchase!                    </div>

                        This is a super fun product! I got this for my husband for our first anniversary.   I will admit, the personalization could be of a little better quality, it is just a flat sticker with your message on it. The map, frame and sticker are probably valued about $50, so it is a little overpriced especially since you have to pay for shipping on top of that. There is no glass covering it (because of the pins, duh), so it does make me wonder why the cost is so high.                      </div>

                        My husband was pleased with the Journeys World Map I purchased from the New York Times Store.     The personalized label at the bottom of the frame is downright cheesy, however. It consists of an inexpertly cut  matboard rectangle with gold lettering pressed onto it in a slipshod manner. I will be removiing the paper label in favor of a small engraved metal one. Overall, I thought this item was priced too high, in view of the quality.                    </div>

                        Interesting project, I enjoyed showing the kids where I had been. The quality is marginal--I do not think I got full value-- but I have hung it high enough so you can't tell. The map projection used changes the bias toward the Northern hemisphere I am used to.   I also found the repeated rating requests annoying.                    </div>

                        I gave the NYT World Map with personalized pins to my daughter--a frequent traveler.  Boy did she like it! Even though she had made her own similar map for herself, she remarked on how elegant the NYT one was.  So the travel map is now in her living room--instead of hidden away in her bedroom.  Well done.                    </div>

                        I bought this map for my husband for Christmas, he loved it. It came 2 days after I ordered it. It is beautiful, and so much fun to stick the pins in to all the places you have traveled. The only recommendation I have is that you order the extra pins. I didn't and we have used up all our pins. I guess we traveled more than I thought.                    </div>

                        The Personalized Journeys World Map is nice with intricate details of places on each country. The only drawback is that the frame is too big. I was expecting a third of it's size. It overpowers the wall. We could not return the map since according to the customer service it is personalized though our names are not stamped on the map, our names are on the cardboard. I guess it will just stay in our storage area. Will find a smaller frame in other store.                    </div>

Not only does it provide an opportunity to see where you have been and offer a chance to relive the experiences, but it whets the appetite for new destinations.

                        I bought this as a gift for me boyfriend and we both absolutely love it! Great size (could be a little bigger) &amp; great quality. Love the antique look. Not heavy at all so it was super easy to mount. Perfect for any world traveler! Highly recommend.                    </div>

                        While I found the map to be exactly what I expected..the number on pins shipped and included in the ridiculously overpriced map package proved not be be sufficient. When I called to request some more..I was told that they would be about $20.00.!!! $20.00 dollars for a package of pins that sells for $2.00 in a craft store was idiotic.    I would never again order from NYT..any friends that have enjoyed and complimented the item..my suggestion is buy it anywhere else.                        </div>

                        This map was a birthday gift for my daughter, a world traveler, and she loved it! I had it personalized and she liked that too. The map arrived well-boxed and in excellent condition. She had fun adding pins to the map, and will add more later this spring! A great gift that will be much appreciated!                    </div>

                        This item was given as an anniversary gift to my parents.  They loved it. I highly recommend this gift to people who travel a lot.  No high-tech stuff here just a great map to track where you came from and are going.  They hung it on the wall and after placing pins (they decided to use only one color, so they ran out) but they are now planning additional trips to cover some gaps.  Nice quality and an even better idea.                    </div>

                        I purchased this map a a gift for my husband after we completed a world cruise. It is tastefully framed map  especially since it was priced lower than any other website we saw it on.  The pins are easy to insert and the map has become quite the conversational piece with visitors to our home.  We are very happy with the purchase.                      </div>

                        The Wall Map was a most welcomed b'day gift from my very thoughtful bride of 37 years. It was a lot of fun to pin all the spots we've visited since actively retiring seven years ago. We're looking forward to positioning many more pins in the years ahead!                    </div>

He is very happy with this map! It is mounted and framed beautifully! I was worried that the personalization would not turn out just like I wanted, but it did!  Perfect! I would not hesitate at all to buy this map again.                    </div>

                        I lived in Europe for 2 1/2 years when I was younger  and traveled extensively.  I have been working internationally for almost 10 years.  I've always wanted to be able to visualize where I've traveled over all that time.  This map is a great addition to my office and a great conversation starter.  It also makes me realize how many more places there are to visit.                    </div>

                        I bought this map for my husband for Christmas, and we both absolutely love it. The frame is beautiful, the map itself is very detailed (more so than other push pin maps I was considering purchasing from other vendors), and the colors are neutral, but warm. I preferred the colors of this map to the colors of the similar map on the NG website. I think it looks very classic, and is a very nice addition to our home.                    </div>

                        We are pleased with our World Travelers Map. We never realized how much traveling we have done over our lifetime. It adds ambience to our collection of artifacts and art we have accumulated through the years. Our World Traveler's Map is also inspiring us to travel in our retirement years. We feel we need to fill up the map. The World Traveler's map was a good purchase and has become a great conversation piece when entertaining quests.                     </div>

                        The map is very nice, my only complaint is that the personalization is just a sticker they put on the map. The frame and map itself is very nice.     They sent me the wrong map at first and fixed it immediately. I was very happy with their customer service. It was top notch.                     </div>

                        The World Map is beautifully designed and impressively detailed - it looks great next to the U.S. map. - they are really designed to go together I think.  I was especially impressed with how up-to-date the map was as it included South Sudan which only recently became its own country.  Personally I would prefer to be able to choose my own pins rather than the set they include, but I just went to an online map store and got exactly the pins I wanted.                    </div>

                        The map is great and perfectly suited for its purpose of marking places you've been.   The yellow pins are a bit hard to see against the map background, but I just used the 3 other colors of pins and this was not a big issue for me. I was a little disappointed at how lightweight and cheap it felt (whole thing weighs no more than 5 pounds), and I was expecting it to be a little sturdier based on the price.                    </div>

                        I was extremely impressed with the world map.  My father has traveld many places and was just headed to Asia for a 1 month trip. This was an excellent Birthday present for him to track all his past and upcoming trips.  It looks very professional and also light enough to hang.

                        The map I ordered was a Christmas gift to my boyfriend.  He and I travel a lot and this was the perfect way for us to map out the vacations we've already taken and the places we want to travel in the future.  The map size is a little large, but it allows for better detail on the map!  Overall we are very pleased with the purchase.  Thanks!                    </div>

                        We gave this to our boss as a holiday gift.  He was absolutely thrilled with it and immediately started placing the pins to mark the places he has been. He will be clearing space on his office wall to proudly hang it.    It is excellent quality map and I like the fact that you can have it personally inscribed.  Great value for the price!                    </div>

                        I am very pleased with the world map where we can place pins showing our travels.  Easy and quick order and delivery process. My only complaint is that when I was having trouble finding the site to order the map, I emailed the Times to get ordering information, and I never received a response.  Fortunately, I finally found the NYT store.                    </div>

I think it is a very good value and it came amazingly fast for something that was personalized. It does say The New York Times above the personalization but I expected that based on the photos. I just wish it was a little less prominent or in a different location.                    </div>

                        I was First a Navy Pilot and flew Constellations (propeller planes) all over the World for MATS.  Then I got a job as Pilot for Pan American World Airways flying 707s and 747s all over the World for 20 years.  Then I went over to United Airlines and flew 757s and 747s as Captain on both domestically and again, all over the World for 12 years.  Everywhere I have been in an airplane has a red pin on that City.  There is one yellow pin on Moulmein in Burma.                    </div>
